          In Solomiya&apos;s very first issue, you will encounter some of those who grew up in an independent Ukraine
          and are paying a huge price for the European integration they seek. We invite you to meet young creatives from
          Kyiv and elsewhere who write <IssueTextImage image="sm1_andrii" />
          <IssueTextImage image="sm1_vsevolod" />, create <IssueTextImage image="sm1_christina" />
          <IssueTextImage image="sm1_sonya" /> and don&rsquo;t stop self-expressing their identities through their
          fashion <IssueTextImage image="sm1_portraits" />. Further, we show for the first time brandnew works by Sasha
          Kurmaz <IssueTextImage image="sm1_kurmaz" />, who also created the cover motif{' '}
          <IssueTextImage image="sm1_cover" />. While Mykola Ridnyi&apos;s iconic series &quot;Blindspot&quot;{' '}
          <IssueTextImage image="sm1_ridnyi" /> recalls the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, a
          protocol traces the lives of two young inhabitants from Bucha who survived the Russian occupation in 2022{' '}
