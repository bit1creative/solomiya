      <p>
        A cookie is a file downloaded to your computer or terminal when you access to our Platform. Cookies allow us,
        among other things, to store and retrieve information about the browsing habits of a user or their equipment and
        depending on the information they contain and the way they use their equipment, they use it to recognize the
        user.
        <br />
        <br />
        The cookies used by Solomiya Collective or a third party acting on its behalf, are associated only with an
        anonymous user and your computer, and we do not store sensitive personal identification information in the
        cookies we use.

      <p className="font-nice-bold">2. PURPOSE</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the cookies, it is possible for Solomiya Collective’s server, or of the third party acting on its
        behalf, to recognize the browser of the computer used by the user in order to make navigation easier. They are
        also used to measure the audience and traffic parameters, monitor the progress and the number of entries.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the same way, Solomiya Collective’s web site servers will automatically detect the IP address and domain name
        used by the user. All this information is later recorded in a server activity file that allows the subsequent
        processing of the data in order to obtain statistical measurements that allow knowing the number of page
        impressions, the number of visits made to the Web services, etc. In any case, said file is subject to
        dissociation processes that prevent the identification of the users’ machine.
